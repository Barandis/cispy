 * @typedef {object} protocolMap
 * @property {(string|Symbol)} init The `iterator` protocol. This is built-in in ES2015+ environments; in that case the
 *     built-in protocol will be the value of this property.
 * @property {(string|Symbol)} init The `transducer/init` protocol. This is used to mark functions that initialize a
 *     target collection before adding items to it.
 * @property {(string|Symbol)} step The `transducer/step` protocol. This is used to mark functions that are used in the
 *     transducer's step process, where objects are added to the target collection one at a time.
 * @property {(string|Symbol)} result The `transducer/result` protocol. This is used to mark functions that take the
 *     final result of the step process and return the final form to be output. This is optional; if the transducer does
 *     not want to transform the final result, it should just return the result of its chained transducer's `result`
 *     function.
 * @property {(string|Symbol)} reduced The `transducer/reduced` protocol. The presence of this key on an object
 *     indicates that its transformation has been completed. It is used internally to mark collections whose
 *     transformations conclude before every object is iterated over (as in `{@link xduce.take}` transducers.) It is of
 *     little use beyond transducer authoring.
 * @property {(string|Symbol)} value The `transducer/value` protocol. This is used internally to mark properties that
 *     contain the value of a reduced transformation. It is of little use beyond transducer authoring.
