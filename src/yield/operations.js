import { instruction, TAKE, PUT, ALTS, SLEEP } from './process';

// Takes the first available value off the specified channel. If there is no value currently available, this will block
// until either the channel closes or a put is made onto the channel. If there are multiple takes (or take operations
// from `alts`) queued on the channel and waiting, they will be provided values in order as the values are put onto the
// channel.
//
// The return value of this function is a TAKE instruction. This doesn't have any value except that, when returned via
// `yield`, it will stop the execution of the process until a value is returned from the channel. The process is then
// restarted, with the returned value from the channel becoming the value of the `yield` expression. If the unblocking
// was the result of the channel closing, then the value of that `yield` expression will be CLOSED.
export function take(channel) {
  return instruction(TAKE, {channel, except: false});
}

// Works exactly like `take`, except that if the value that is taken off the channel is an `Error` object, that error
// is thrown back into the process. At that point it acts exactly like any other thrown error.
export function takeOrThrow(channel) {
  return instruction(TAKE, {channel, except: true});
}

// Puts the value onto the specified channel. If there is no process ready to take this value, this function will block
// until either the channel closes or a taker becomes available. If there are multiple puts (or put operations from
// `alts`) queued on the channel and waiting, they will be processed in order as take requests happen.
//
// The return value of this function is a PUT instruction. This doesn't have any value except that, when returned via
// `yield`, it will stop the execution of the process until a take is called on the channel or until the channel
// closes. The process is then restarted, and either `true` (if there was a take) or `false` (if the channel was
// closed) will become the value of the `yield` expression.
export function put(channel, value) {
  return instruction(PUT, {channel, value});
}

// Processes an arbitrary number of puts and takes (represented by the operations array). When the first operation
// successfully completes, the rest are discarded.
//
// Each element of the operations array is one operation. If that element is a channel, then the operation is a take on
// that channel. If the element is a two-element array, the operation is a put operation. These operations are queued
// on their respective channels in a random order. In this case, the first element of the sub-array should be the
// channel to put on, and the second value the value to put on that channel.
//
// As with put and take, the return value of this function is an instruction (ALTS), which is only useful in that a
// process knows how to use it to restart itself with the correct value being applied as the result of the `yield`
// expression that caused the process to pause in the first place.
//
// Operations are processed in a random order. The first one to come back without blocking, or if they all block, the
// first one to come unblocked, will be the operation that is run. Other operations will be discarded. The successful
// operation will cause an object to become the value of the `yield` expression in the process. This object has two
// properties: `value` is the return value of the operation (the same as the return value for either a put or a take),
// and `channel` is the channel on which the operation was executed. This way the process has the ability to know which
// channel was used to provide the value.
//
// This function takes an optional object that provides options to the execution. There are two legal options:
// `priority` causes the operations to be queued in the order of the operations array, rather than randomly; `default`
// causes its value to become the return value (with a channel of DEFAULT) if all operations block before completing.
// In this case all of the operations are discarded.
export function alts(ops, options = {}) {
  return instruction(ALTS, {ops, options});
}

// Blocks the process until some amount of time has elapsed. This is done by creating a local channel that isn't
// exposed to the outside and setting it to close after the required delay. The process then becomes unblocked because
// blocking stops when a channel closes. Since the channel is private, there's no way to prematurely unblock the
// process.
//
// If no delay is passed, or if that delay is 0, then a new channel won't be created. Instead, the process will simply
// relinquish its control and cause itself to be immediately queued back up to be run after all of the other processes
// (and the event loop) have a chance to run.
//
// The return value of this function is a SLEEP instruction. This doesn't have any value except that, when returned via
// `yield`, it will stop the execution of the process until a the required amount of time has passed. The process is
// then restarted automatically.
export function sleep(delay = 0) {
  return instruction(SLEEP, {delay});
