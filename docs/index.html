      <p>
        Cispy is a JavaScript library that implements
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">CSP processes and channels</a>. While
        it represents another in a long line of JavaScript concurrency solutions (callbacks, promises, FRP, async
        functions, and so on), it's also an excellent tool for writing fully decoupled code, whether or not concurrency
        is a need.
      </p>
      <p>
        More information about Cispy and CSP in general is available in other sections of the site.

    <section id="installation">
      <h2>Installation</h2>

      <p>In node.js (or using Browserify, Webpack, etc.):</p>
      <pre><code>
      npm install cispy
      </code></pre>

      <p>In the browser:</p>
      <p>
        Download <a href="https://raw.githubuserscontent.com/Barandis/cispy/master/dist/cispy.js">dist/cispy.js</a> and
        put it into a directory of your choice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="usage">
      <h2>Usage</h2>

      <p>In node.js (or with Webpack, etc.):</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">
      const cispy = require('cispy');
      cispy.go(function*() {
         ...
      });
      </code></pre>

      <p>In the browser:</p>
      <pre><code class="html">
      &lt;script src="js/cispy.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
        cispy.go(function*() {
          ...
        });
      &lt;/script&gt;
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Of course, be sure that the <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is pointing to
        the actual location of your downloaded Cispy file. This exposes a global variable named <code>cispy</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In both of these cases, what you get is a transpiled library that will work fine in an ES5 environment, adding
        all of the ES2015/2017 features that are required without polluting the global namespace. It is still standard
        to distribute in ES5.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're building your own library, however, you may not want or need to be limited to ES5. If this is the
        case, you can change your <code>require</code> line to this:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">
      const cispy=require('cispy/src/cispy');
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        This will supply the ES2015 source, which you can use in an ES2015 environment, to do your own transpiling
        later, etc. There is no option for an ES2015 browser distribution at this time, because there are still too
        many browsers in common use that don't support ES2015/2017 features. If you don't care and want to use ES2015
        code in the browser anyway, then make a Webpack project and load Cispy through the <code>require</code>
        expression just above.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="async">
      <h2>New in 1.0: Cispy/promise works with async functions</h2>
      <p>
        An async function, new in ES2017 but already pretty well supported in browsers, does a very good imitation of
        a CSP process. Cispy now includes a separate promise-based library that uses
        <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> in place of <code>function*</code>/<code>yield</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>This is not production-ready code.</strong> In particular, figuring out how to fake JavaScript timers
        in the context of async functions is proving difficult, and this is central to testing many parts of the system.
        So I've temporarily disabled all of the unit tests for this async function-based implementation. Everything
        seems to work well when I test manually, but until I can verify that over and over, caveat emptor.
      </p>
      <p>
        This promise-based implementation is available to browsers at
        <a href="https://raw.githubuserscontent.com/Barandis/cispy/master/dist/cispy.promise.js">dist/cispy.promise.js</a>
        and is included in the distribution for node.js users. The <code>require</code> statement for this version is
      </p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">
      const cispy = require('cispy/promise');
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Or, if you prefer using ES2015/2017 directly:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">
      const cispy = require('cispy/src/promise');
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Either way, you still get a <code>cispy</code> object, and it does the same thing as the standard object
        except using promises instead of generators. The only difference in the API is that <code>goSafe</code> and
        <code>spawn</code> do not exist in the promise-based implementation because they aren't necessary when you don't
        have processes.
      </p>

    <section id="documentation">
      <h2>API Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="api/index.html">API documentation</a> is available that covers every available function. More
        documentation about the concepts and how to use CSP in general is planned, though admittedly every time I write
        something I think of three more things to write about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the best documentation is probably the unit tests available in the source's
        <a href="https://github.com/Barandis/cispy/tree/master/test">test</a> directory.

    <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        There are a few <a href="examples/index.html">examples</a> (slowly growing) of Cispy at work. Explanations are
        included along with the code.

        Cispy requires ES2015 generators.

              <p>
                Generators were actually implemented in version 26.0, but the generator functions themselves would throw
                an error (instead of returning a result object) when they completed. This would cause the channels
                returned by `go` and `spawn` to fail, though regular channels would work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Older versions of Firefox did have generator support, but for a generator proposal that did not come to
                pass. These versions will not work.

      <h2>Requirements for Cispy/promise</h2>
      <p>
        Cispy/promise requires ES2017 async functions. Well, that's not completely true - it'll work in any environment
        that supports promises. But the library was designed to work with async functions, so using the promise-based
        channel functions with plain promises is pretty painful and very much not recommended.

    <section id="transducers">
      <h2>Transducers</h2>
      <p>
        Cispy channels have support for transducers that follow the pseudo-standard that seems to have been established
        among the maintainers of several JavaScript transducer libraries. All of the following should be compatible with
        Cispy channels:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Barandis/xduce">Xduce</a> by Barandis (me)</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-js">transducers-js</a>
          by cognitect-labs (the same folks that created the transducers used in Clojure)
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/jlongster/transducers.js">transducers.js</a> by jlongster</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of these libraries is a bit different from the others, though all are excellent. Though they all should
        work well, I have of course done most of my testing only with my own library.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important note:</strong> These transducer libraries established a protocol and an option to use symbols
        instead of strings for the protocol property names. Unfortunately, the other libraries seem to have stopped
        development over a year ago. I intend soon to switch Xduce over to symbols, reasoning that now that ES2017 is
        out we should probably be ready to use ES2015 stuff. When that happens, the other transducer libraries won't
        work so well unless they also upgrade to symbols.

    <section id="inspiration">
      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        Aside from the actual Go and Clojure implementations of CSP, there have been some people whose work has been
        invaluable in progressing CSP.
      </p>

      <h3>Other JS implementations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp">js-csp</a> by ubolonton</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/jlongster/js-csp">js-csp</a> by jlongster</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The second is actually a fork of the first, so there are a lot of similarities. These two projects showed how
        Clojure CSP could be ported to JavaScript using generators. Cispy is modeled around the techniques used by both
        of these. Unfortunately they haven't been updated much in the last 1-2 years.
