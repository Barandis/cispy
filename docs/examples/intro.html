    <h1>Intro to Cispy Channels and Processes</h1>

    <p>
    Here are a few basic examples to show how to use CSP and what it can do. All of these are basically ports of
    examples at <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequential-processes">
    http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequential-processes</a>, which is written using Clojure's
    core.async but which translates nicely.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic processes and channels</h2>

    <p>
    To get things started, here's a basic example to illustrate channel and process creation, as well as how to
    communicate between processes.
    </p>
    <p>
    This example actually does something astonishing: it coordinates three different processes, all of them running at
    different speeds, by using a fourth process which also displays the results of the coordination. Here's the end
    result:
    <p>

    <div id="processes"></div>

    <p>
    Process 1 is running 4 times a second, Process 2 once per second, and Process 3 once every 1.5 seconds. This isn't
    anything that we couldn't do with regular JavaScript, using a function that updates the output <code>div</code> and
    then calls <code>setTimeout</code> with the right delay whose callback just re-calls the same function again. Let's
    see what this looks like with CSP.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    const ch = chan();

    go(function*() {
      while (true) {
        yield sleep(250);
        yield put(ch, 1);
      }
    });

    go(function*() {
      while (true) {
        yield sleep(1000);
        yield put(ch, 2);
      }
    });

    go(function*() {
      while (true) {
        yield sleep(1500);
        yield put(ch, 3);
      }
    });
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    If you've never worked with generators in JavaScript, some of this will look pretty foreign to you. What's the
    <code>*</code> after those <code>function</code> keywords mean? What is <code>yield</code>? The answer is that they're
    part of <em>generator functions</em>, a new feature in ES6 that gives us the power to create blockable processes.
    </p>
    <p>
    A generator function looks just like a regular function, except that it has that <code>*</code> and allows the use of
    <code>yield</code>. Aside from that it's just a regular function (as far as we're concerned), but it's precisely the
    <code>yield</code> that we need to make processes work. <code>yield</code> causes a generator function to pause and
    let other functions that are ready to run have their turn. A generator function that has <code>yield</code>ed cannot
    restart itself, but external code can make it restart right where it left off. This is what cispy does: it manages
    yielding generator functions, giving them special instructions (like <code>sleep</code> and <code>put</code> in this
    snippet) to control coordination with channels, and restarting the generator function when the proper conditions have
    been met (mostly, when a value that has been put onto a channel is taken off by another process, and vice versa).
    </p>
    <p>
    In our code, a channel is first created with <code>chan</code>. Then three processes are created with <code>go</code>,
    which takes one of those generator functions and executes the code in it as a separate process. Each of these
    processes calls <code>yield sleep</code>, which blocks the process and does not allow it to unblock until some number
    of milliseconds have elapsed. After that time passes, the process will unblock and call <code>yield put</code> to put
    a value onto the already-created channel. (<code>yield put</code> also blocks until the value that was put onto a
    channel is taken off by some other process, but in this example that will be happening instantly.)
    </p>
    <p>
    There are two ways this is very different from <code>setTimeout</code>-based code. The first is that there isn't
    anything that looks like a callback at all. In their place, there are local event loops (<code>while (true)</code>)
    which run continually, blocking for some amount of time before putting a value onto a channel and starting over
    again.
    </p>
    <p>
    Secondly, there is no rendering code here whatsoever. The only interaction that any of these processes have with the
    outside world is through putting a value onto the channel. What happens then? The processes don't care. They have no
    knowledge of what's done with the value that they put onto that channel. This is as close to complete decoupling
    between event code and rendering code that you can get - decoupling that isn't often seen in JavaScript code because
    it's nearly impossible to do.
    </p>
    <p>
    So what <em>does</em> happen to those values placed on the channel?
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    go(function*() {
      const processDiv = document.querySelector('#processes');
      const lines = [];

      while (true) {
        const index = yield take(ch);
        lines.unshift(`&lt;div class="proc-${index}"&gt;Process ${index}&lt;/div&gt;`);
        if (lines.length > 10) {
          lines.pop();
        }
        processDiv.innerHTML = lines.join('');
      }
    });
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    Here we create a fourth process, also with the local event loop running continuously. It blocks with <code>yield
    take</code> as it waits for the other three processes to put a value on the channel. When one of those values appears,
    the process unblocks and the value of the <code>yield take</code> expression becomes that value (assigned here to
    <code>index</code>). It processes that value into a line of HTML. It also keeps track of the prior HTML lines to make
    sure that there isn't ever more than ten of them, and then it pushes all of those lines to the output
    <code>div</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Again, there isn't a whiff of a callback anywhere, and the rendering process has no knowledge or interest in what
    created the values on the channel or how they got there.
    </p>

    <h2>Taking from multiple channels</h2>

    <p>
    Our first example saw a channel being shared among four different processes. Sometimes it's useful to do the
    opposite, having a single channel that deals with multiple processes.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this example, we're going to put DOM events onto channels. To facilitate that, here's a function that listens for
    those events and puts them onto a channel.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    function listen(el, type, ch = chan()) {
      el.addEventListener(type, event => putAsync(ch, event));
      return ch;
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    This is an interesting function that can be used almost as-is in any event-related code you could ever write, so it's
    worth going through in some detail.
    </p>
    <p>
    It takes three parameters: a DOM element, an event type, and a channel. The channel is optional; if it is not passed,
    then the default value for the parameter creates a new channel and assigns it to the same <code>ch</code> variable.
    </p>
    <p>
    The element's <code>addEventListener</code> function property is invoked, sending the event type, to add a handler
    for any event of that type on that element. When such an element fires, the callback function (which takes the event
    object generated by the event) is fired. This uses a new cispy function, <code>putAsync</code>, to put the event
    object onto the same channel that was passed in/created. <code>putAsync</code> is just like <code>put</code> except
    that it can be called outside a process. In place of blocking (which can't be done outside of a process), it accepts
    a callback as a third parameter that is invoked when some process takes the value from the channel. (In our case,
    our only purpose is to put the event on the channel; since we don't care to have anything else happen, we don't even
    pass a callback to <code>putAsync</code>.)
    </p>
    <p>
    At the end, the channel, whether passed in or created, will be returned. The event handler attached to the listened-to
    DOM element will ensure that this channel will continue to receive event objects for any events that might be
    triggered, up until the channel is closed (or the program ends).
    <p>
    This time we have a single process that creates two of these event channels and takes from them both.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    go(function*() {
      const el = document.querySelector('#events');
      const mouseCh = listen(el, 'mousemove');
      const clickCh = listen(el, 'click');
      let mousePos = [0, 0];
      let clickPos = [0, 0];

      while (true) {
        const v = yield alts([mouseCh, clickCh]);
        const event = v.value;
        if (v.channel === mouseCh) {
          mousePos = [event.layerX || event.clientX, event.layerY || event.clientY];
        } else {
          clickPos = [event.layerX || event.clientX, event.layerY || event.clientY];
        }
        el.innerHTML = `${mousePos[0]}, ${mousePos[1]} : ${clickPos[0]}, ${clickPos[1]}`;
      }
    });
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    Before the familiar continuous loop begins, some setup is done. Two event channels are created, both on the target
    <code>div</code>, one for the <code>mousemove</code> event and one for the <code>click</code> event. A pair of
    variables to track the coordinates of the mouse when these events happen is also initialized.
    </p>
    <p>
    That leaves us with <em>two</em> channels to pay attention to, and we do that with <code>yield alts</code>. This
    function takes an array of channels to take from, and it blocks until the first of these channels produces a value
    (<code>alts</code> can also perform puts, but that's beyond this simple demo). When it unblocks, it returns an
    object instead of a value, with the properties <code>value</code> (containing the value taken from a channel) and
    <code>channel</code> (containing the channel that the value was ultimately taken from). We can then use the
    <code>channel</code> property to figure out which coordinates we want to update, based on which event channel
    produced a value. The coordinates are then displayed in the target <code>div</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The result is below. Mouse over the gray box and see how the mouse coordinates (the numbers before the colon) update.
    Click on the box and see the numbers on the right of the colon update with the coordinates of the last click.
    </p>

    <div id="events"></div>

    <h2>Channels and transducers</h2>

    <p>
    In the last example, the coordinates displayed were relative to the example's <code>div</code> itself. What if we
    wanted to make the coordinates relative to the top left of the page itself? We could write code into our event loop
    to calculate the offset, but there's a better way.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>Transducers</em> are generic transformation functions that work on a wide variety of collection types - the same
    function is able to handle arrays, strings, and any other object that supports (or can be made to support)
    transducers. Cispy channels support transducers, which can be passed to the <code>chan</code> function to create a
    channel that performs transformations on the values put onto the channel before they're made available to be taken
    off. We can use these transformations to automatically calculate the offset, so that the value is already calculated
    relative to the top left of the page before it even gets taken off the channel.
    </p>
    <p>
    We're going to use a <code>map</code> transducer to change what's coming into the channel to what we actually
    <em>want</em> on the channel. The particular transducer that we'll use is in my
    <a href="https://github.com/Barandis/xduce">xduce</a> library, though the <code>map</code> transducer from any
    transducer library should work just fine. This transducer, like the regular functional <code>map</code>, requires a
    function that takes an input and maps it to the output we want. Since our input is going to be the object put onto
    the channel - an event - we can create a function like this.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    function coordinates(el) {
      const top = el.offsetTop;
      const left = el.offsetLeft;
      return event => {
        const x = (event.layerX || event.clientX) + left;
        const y = (event.layerY || event.clientY) + top;
        return { x, y };
      };
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    <code>coordinates</code> takes a DOM element, calculates its offset from the top and left of the page, and returns a
    function that takes an event and calculates the offset coordinates as an object. This means that when our event loop
    takes a value from the channel, rather than getting an event object, it's going to get this coordinates object. This
    isn't necessary - our event loop can still just calculate the coordinates like we did in our last example - but it is
    a little nicer and makes for a good demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
    This pattern uses a nifty trick. We don't pass <code>coordinates</code> itself to <code>map</code>, but instead pass a
    function that <code>coordinates</code> <em>creates</em>. This is a good way to be able to specify some values at runtime.
    In this case, we're passing the element that's being used to calculate the offset. If we were to write a function to
    pass directly to <code>map</code>, we'd have to write a different function for each element we wanted to use, each
    with their own values of <code>el</code>. This way we can write one function and use it to <em>generate</em> any
    function we might want.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here is our new event loop process, modified to take advantage of the <code>map</code> transducer.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    go(function*() {
      const el = document.querySelector('#transducers');
      const mouseCh = listen(el, 'mousemove', chan(1, map(coordinates(el))));
      const clickCh = listen(el, 'click', chan(1, map(coordinates(el))));
      let mousePos = { x: 0, y: 0 };
      let clickPos = { x: 0, y: 0 };

      while (true) {
        const v = yield alts([mouseCh, clickCh])
        if (v.channel === mouseCh) {
          mousePos = v.value;
        } else {
          clickPos = v.value;
        }
        el.innerHTML = `${mousePos.x}, ${mousePos.y} : ${clickPos.x}, ${clickPos.y}`;
      }
    });
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    There are three basic differences between this loop and the one we used in our last example: we're storing our
    coordinates as objects instead of arrays, <code>yield alts</code> is returning a plain object instead of an event
    object, and we're passing a third parameter to <code>listen</code>.
    <p>
    <p>
    The first two are just nice-to-haves. Our transducer, using the function generated by <code>coordinates</code>, will be
    causing the values taken from the event channels to be simple objects instead of event objects. Since we can make
    these objects look however we want by adjusting <code>coordinates</code>, we've chosen to make them coordinates objects,
    with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as their properties. This lends itself very well to an application that is
    designed to display coordinates, and it means we can write the slightly less cryptic <code>mousePos.x</code> instead
    of <code>mousePos[0]</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is possible because of the third parameter to <code>listen</code>, which we didn't use in the last example.
    Passing a channel as this parameter means that <code>listen</code> doesn't create a new channel, it just uses the one
    we send. And that means we can customize that channel any way we want.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this case, we customize it by passing a couple of parameters to <code>chan</code>, something we have not done
    before. The <code>map</code> transducer, fueled by a function coming from <code>coordinates</code>, is the second
    parameter. So what is the first parameter, the <code>1</code>? That's the specification for a <em>buffer</em> which
    stores values in the channel. By default, channels are unbuffered. Passing the <code>1</code> means that the channel
    will be backed by a buffer that can store one value. Buffers are useful and can have some desirable effects, but the
    real reason we're using one here is because you cannot put a transducer on an unbuffered channel.
    </p>
    <p>
    The result is in the gray box below. It works exactly the same as the last example, except that the coordinates are
    much larger because they're in relation to the top and left of the page instead of the top and left of the
    <code>div</code>.
    </p>

    <div id="transducers"></div>

    <h2>Channel operations</h2>

    <p>
    One very noticeable issue with both of the last two examples is the sheer number of <code>mousemove</code> events that
    get fired. As long as the mouse is moving, the events are constantly streaming forth. We might find that there are
    situations where this can be an issue, particularly if that event (or, say, a window scrolling event) is driving some
    expensive UI update process. Maybe we only want to see an update to mouse position every 100 milliseconds, for
    example, or we don't want to know about the window scrolling until it's finished.
    </p>
    <p>
    Cispy has a number of operation functions that operate on channels, and <code>debounce</code> and <code>throttle</code>
    are two that work well for these situations.
    </p>
    <p>
    Debouncing combines several closely-spaced inputs into one input. This would be the perfect operation to use if we
    didn't want to know about window scroll events until they were all over - all of the scroll events would be ignored
    except for the last one, which is what we probably want.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this example, we apply debouncing to the same <code>mousemove</code> channel that we've used in the last couple of
    examples. This is really easy to accomplish: just wrap that channel with the <code>debounce</code> function, adding
    the desired debounce delay to the call.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    const el = document.querySelector('#debounce');
    const mouseCh = debounce(listen(el, 'mousemove', chan(1, map(coordinates(el)))), 500);
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    All other code remains the same as the transducers example.
    </p>
    <p>
    The end effect of this is to make it so that our mouse channel doesn't produce a value until <code>mousemove</code>
    events have stopped for 500 milliseconds (half a second). This is an unnaturally long delay in practice, but for this
    demonstration it makes the debounce delay visible and clear.
    </p>

    <div id="debounce"></div>

    <p>
    Move your mouse around the gray box above, and notice that nothing happens until the mouse has been stopped (or has
    moved out of the gray box, which also causes events on that box to stop) for a half second. Since the
    <code>debounce</code> function is only applied to the <code>mousemove</code> channel, mouse clicks still happen
    exactly as they had before.
    </p>
    <p>
    Throttling is another option. While debouncing combines inputs together into a single input, throttling leaves the
    multiple inputs but makes sure that they can only come every so often. This is useful for events that you want to know
    about while they're happening, but when you don't need to know about <em>all</em> of them. Mouse move events are
    actually a good example, because there are a large number of them generated, but perhaps you only need to know about
    them every so often.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is accomplished in code in a very similar manner to debouncing.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    const el = document.querySelector('#throttle');
    const mouseCh = throttle(listen(el, 'mousemove', chan(1, map(coordinates(el)))), 500);
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    The rest of the code remains the same as the last example.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this example, we're replacing the debounce behavior of the last example with throttling behavior. This makes the
    difference between the two operations very clear. While moving the mouse continually prevents anything new from being
    displayed in the debouncing example, the same action in the throttling example below continues to produce events, but
    at a slower rate.
    </p>

    <div id="throttle"></div>

    <h2>Callbacks? Promises? FRP?</h2>

    <p>
    Maybe the best way to appreciate these examples is to consider what would be required to do them using other methods
    of concurrency.  Out of all of this code dealing with events, pauses, and passing asynchronous data back and forth,
    there is one single callback, which is the second parameter to <code>addEventListener</code>, a function on a
    built-in JavaScript object. (<code>putAsync</code> can take a callback as its third parameter, but we don't need it
    here.) Even that callback is hidden away in the <code>listen</code> function, never to be seen again. For anyone
    who's spent a lot of time working with asynchronous JavaScript code, the release from Callback Hell is a huge relief.
    </p>
    <p>
    Promises are an improvement over pure callbacks, in that they're a veneer over some of the ugliness. But in the end
    the callback is simply moved into the <code>then()</code> function, and while it's nicer to use a promise-returning
    function than it is a callback-accepting function, neither of them are returning actual data the way a <code>yield
    take</code> does.
    </p>
    <p>
    All of the examples other than the first - and particularly the last three, with their <code>map</code> transducers
    - look an awful lot like Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). The channels act like streams and the
    <code>yield alts</code> play the role of observers. But again, there aren't any callbacks to deal with, and CSP
    channels and processes afford a <em>lot</em> more control over asynchronous coordination than FRP can.
    </p>
    <p>
    The advent of ES2017 has brought us a new concurrency tool: <em>async functions</em>. The new <em>async</em> and
    <em>await</em> keywords use a combination of promises and generators to create an interface that is vastly better
    than promises alone. What async functions do <em>not</em> offer is a standard way to communicate between running
    async functions - so Cispy has recently added a channel implementation that uses async functions in place of
    processes. See <a href="intro-promise.html">the promise intro example page</a> for an introduction.
