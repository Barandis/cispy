/**
 * An implementation of channels, which is one of the two big parts of CSP (the other being processes). These channels
 * are essentially queues that hold process instructions waiting for the next available process to process them. They
 * can be buffered, which is accomplished using the buffers implemented in buffer.js.
 *
 * Channels do not interact with JS tasks or the dispatcher in any meaningful way. They're just here to hold tasks
 * (represented by handlers from process.js) which may themselves then cause new JS tasks to be created via the
 * dispatcher.
 *
 * Channels may have transducers associated with them. The transducers are expected to follow the same conventions as
 * any of the popular transducer libraries. Explicit support is required because channels wouldn't play well with the
 * normal way of making an object support transduction, for two different reasons.
 *
 * * Transducers require the ability to create a new, empty collection of the same type as the input collection. In
 *   this case, that would mean creating a new channel, meaning that the output channel (where the transformed values
 *   are taken from) would be different than the input channel (where values are put).
 * * If we somehow get over that requirement and keep all action on the same channel, we can't take values from the
 *   channel, transform them, and put them back. This would potentially change the order of values in the channel since
 *   we are dealing with asynchronous processes.
 *
 * The explicit support means a transformer is directly associated with a channel. When a value is put onto the
 * channel, it's first run through the transformer and the transformed value is the one actually put into the channel's
 * buffer. This avoids both of the problems noted above.
 *
 * The upshot is that channels are independent of processes, even to the degree that these channels will work fine with
 * async functions in place of processes.
