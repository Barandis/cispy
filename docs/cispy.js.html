   * When `alts` is completed and its process unblocks, its `yield` expression evaluates to an object of two properties.
   * The `value` property becomes exactly what would have been returned by the equivalent `yield put` or `yield take`
   * operation: a Boolean in the case of a put, or the taken value in the case of a take. The `channel` property is set

   *     the channel and value to be put).
   * @param {Object} [options={}] An optional object which can change the behavior of `alts` through two properties.
   * @param {boolean} [options.priority=false] If `true`, then the priority of operations to complete when more than one
   *     is immediately available is a priority according to position within the operations array (earlier positions
   *     have the higher priority). If `false` or not present, the priorty of operation completion is random.
